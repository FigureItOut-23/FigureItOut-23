### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a first year Mechatronics Student at the University of Waterloo. While my programming journey has only just started, I am very eager to learn more and deepen my knowledge on software development. 
Currently, most of my experience lies in the fundamentals and OOP. I am also taking a course on Data Structures and Algorithms as I try to learn new important programming skills.
I am most comfortable working with C and C++, but am also developing my knowledge in languages such as Python and JavaScript, frameworks like React.js and Node.js, and in front-end tools like CSS and HTML.
Outside of school, I am a member of UW Midnight Sun's Firmware subteam [https://www.uwmidsun.com/] and use C to help develop control software to drive the electrical system of the car.
